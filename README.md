Boris Bikes
================
Week 1 at Makers Academy.

Object Oriented model of the Boris Bikes London bicycle system.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to:

- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD);
- How BDD relates to Test Driven Development (TDD), and
- The process of domain modeling for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (which is strongly related to DDD - Domain Driven Design).

Paired with [Riz](https://github.com/RizAli), we wrote this code using TDD best practices with RSpec.

Technologies used

- Ruby
- RSpec
